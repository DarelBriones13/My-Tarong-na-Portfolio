                <p class="aligned-text" style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">My SHS first website. This is my first website I've ever done. My instructor of this project is the one who motivate me to pursue This
                  course for it was an amazing course. This project means a lot for me, for it was the most amazing exprience I've been through my shs life. I am very proud of what I've done
                  with all my hardwork. All the hardwork has been paid.

                <p class="aligned-text" style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> In my 1st Year College, this is the final project that i made in programming using python language, it is kinda challenging because 
                  it was my first time making an information system and its quiet difficult but still it is worth it because I've got a high grades in this project.
                </p>
                <p class="aligned-text" style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">In my 2nd Year College, this is the final project of the first semester that we made with my partner in programming using java language with GUI, it is also challenging and stress because 
                  it was not easy to make a code with logic and applying validation specially finding the errors of the code but still it is worth it because I've got a high grades in this project.
